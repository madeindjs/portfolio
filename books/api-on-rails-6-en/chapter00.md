"API on Rails 6" is based on ["APIs on Rails: Building REST APIs with Rails"](http://apionrails.icalialabs.com/book/). It was initially published in 2014 by [Abraham Kuri](https://twitter.com/kurenn) under the licenses [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) and [Beerware](http://people.freebsd.org/~phk/).

The first version was not maintained and was initially planned for Ruby on Rails version 4, which does not [receive more than security updates](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/maintenance_policy.html#security-issues). I wanted to update this excellent book, adapting it to new versions of Ruby on Rails. Therefore, this book is available for Ruby on Rails versions 5.2 and 6.0 (the one you are currently reading).

NOTE: This book is also available in the MoliÃ¨re language (It means french).

## About the author

My name is [Alexandre Rousseau](https://rsseau.fr), and I am a Rails developer with more than 4 years of experience (at the time of writing). I am currently a partner in a company (https://isignif.fr[iSignif]) to build and maintain a SAAS product using Rails. I also contribute to the Ruby community by producing and maintaining some gems that you can consult on [my Rubygems.org profile](https://rubygems.org/profiles/madeindjs). Most of my projects are on GitHub, then don't hesitate to [follow me](http://github.com/madeindjs/).
