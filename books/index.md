Learn **best practices** to build an **API** using **Node.js / Typescript** and following libraries:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) / [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) as HTTP server
- [TypeORM](typeorm.io/) as ORM with [SQlite database](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) (but you can use Postgres or MySQL too)
- Test Driven Development because I think this is a best way to code
