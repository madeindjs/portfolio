  - Hi, I'm Alexandre.
  - I am a Fulstack developer / DevOPS.

description:
  - I am passionate about programming and the world of open source software. I try to contribute to the open-source world at my personal projects and various contributions on <a href="https://github.com/madeindjs">Github</a> / <a href="https://gitlab.com/alexandre.rousseau">Gitlab</a>.
  - I have written two books under a free license. <a href="https://github.com/madeindjs/api_on_rails">API on Rails</a> and <a href="https://github.com/madeindjs/rest-api.ts">REST-API.ts</a> that teach best practices for building an API with Ruby on Rails or Node.js  (I wrote about it <a href="/en/story/2019/11/10/api-on-rails.html">in this post</a>).
  - Besides that, I like to share my findings via <a href="/en/blog">posts on my blog</a>.
