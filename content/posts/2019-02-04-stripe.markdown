For my [iSignif](https://isignif.fr) project I wanted to implement **restricted access** functionality for **premium account**. The ultimate goal is for the user to subscribe to a premium account in order to access certain pages.

In order to implement this functionality, we first analyzed the need. The expected behaviour is as follows:

1. the customer benefits from one month of discovery of our tool as soon as he registers
2. once his _balance of premium days_ is exhausted, he receives an email indicating that he will have to buy back days
3. the user updates his balance by making a **on-time payment** which adds one month to his premium balance where he takes out a subscription which will make a **automatic payment** at the beginning of each month

In order to implement this, I quickly went through the existing payment solutions (PayPal, BNP, etc...). It turned out that [Stripe](https://stripe.com) was the best compromise.

![Stripe's logo](./images/stripe.svg)

> Stripe is an American company that aims to simplify online payments. Created in 2010, Stripe now weighs more than 10 billion!

I chose Stripe because its advantages are:

- the customer can pay without having an account opened at Stripe
- the rates are quite "reasonable" _(1.4% + 0.25€ per transaction for European cards)_
- the ease of implementation because, in addition to offering a beautiful API, Stripe offers libraries for the most commonly used languages ([PHP](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-php), [Pyhton](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-python),[Ruby](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ruby), [Java](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-java) and even [Go](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-go)
- an [excellent documentation](https://stripe.com/docs)

In addition, Stripe goes much further than a _simple_ payment solution since it offers a whole ecosystem to manage customers, invoices, products, etc....

In this article I will therefore retrace the development of the functionality by trying to be as generic as possible. I also specify before starting that it is not a sponsored item and I did not receive any money from Stripe (I would have liked...).

**TLDR**: Stripe is very simple to set up and really allows us to completely delegate payment management. This allows you to focus on your business and is invaluable for a project that is just beginning.

## Implementation of the premium mode

In this first part I will talk to you about the implementation of the _premium_ feature. Here we will just code the expected behavior without touching Stripe for the moment (be patient...).

### Modifying `User` model

We will therefore start setting up a system to restrict certain pages to _premium_ users.

The idea is to add a `premium_until` [`DateTime`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/DateTime.html) attribute which will contains validity date of the premium account. So we add this column for the `users` table.

```bash
rails g migration add_premium_until_to_users premium_until:date
```

This command will generate this migration:

```ruby
# db/migrate/20190116132207_add_premium_until_to_users.rb
class AddPremiumUntilToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.2]
  def change
    add_column :users, :premium_until, :date
  end
end
```

Since we are generous we will also create an additional migration to **offer one month** to all existing users:

```bash
rails g migration offer_one_monthspremiumto_users
```

We're just looping through all the existing users

```ruby
# db/migrate/20190116132207_add_premium_until_to_users.rb
# ...
def up
  premium_until_offer = DateTime.now + 1.month
  User.all.each { |user| user.update! premium_until: premium_until_offer }
end
```

There you go.

### Creation of the premium logic

We now have a nice `premium_until` column who contains the **validity date** of the premium account. We want to **create** a `User#increment_premium` method who will be called when a payment is received. This one will simply add one month to the `premium_until` attribute.

Let's create the unit tests that define the expected behavior of this function. This method is **very important** so we will cover all possible cases:

- when the user already has a balance of days

```ruby
# test/models/user_test.rb
test 'should offer one month premium to user' do
  user = User.create!(
    premium_until: (Date.today + 5.days)
    # ...
  )

  assert_equal (Date.today + 1.month + 5.days), user.premium_until
end
```

- when the user does not yet have a day balance

```ruby
# test/models/user_test.rb
test 'should set correct premium_until for never premium user' do
  user = User.new
  user.increment_premium
  assert_equal (Date.today + 1.month), user.premium_until
end
```

- checks that we add one month from today for a user who has just reactivated his account after an inactivity

```ruby
# test/models/user_test.rb
test 'should set correct premium_until for past-premium user' do
  user = User.new(premium_until: (Date.today - 1.year))
  user.increment_premium
  assert_equal (Date.today + 1.month), user.premium_until
end
```

I think these tests are sufficient to cover all possible cases. We have written a lot of tests but the implementation is very short:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  before_create :increment_premium

  def increment_premium
    if premium_until.nil? || (premium_until < Date.today)
      self.premium_until = Date.today
    end
    self.premium_until += 1.month
  end
  # ...
end
```

There you go. The tests are now passing:

```bash
bin/rails test test/models/user_test.rb
# Running:

....
```

### Restrictions actions

Implementing the restriction is really easy but let's start by writing the unit tests. We will therefore create two **fixtures** _(fixtures are data inserted in the database in order to test the application)_ one representing a premium user and another representing an expired user.

```yml
# test/fixtures/users.yml
premium_advocate:
  premium_until: <%= DateTime.now + 1.month %>
  # ...

expired_advocate:
  premium_until: <%= DateTime.now - 1.month %>
  # ...
```

Now let's imagine a page only authorized for premium users. The test is quite easy:

1. We connect a user
2. You can access the page
3. we check that the answer is 200 (= _success_) if the user is premium and otherwise we check that the user is redirected to the Stripe payment page

So here is the implementation of the tests:

```ruby
# test/controllers/acts_controller_test.rb
class ActsControllerTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest

  test 'should forbid get index for non-premium user' do
    login users(:expired_advocate)
    get acts_url
    assert_response root_path
  end

  test 'should get index for premium user' do
    login users(:premium_advocate)
    get acts_url
    assert_response :success
  end
  # ...
end
```

If you run the tests at this point you will get a pretty mistake like that:

```
ActsControllerTest#test_should_forbid_get_index_for_non-premium_user
Expected response to be a <3XX: redirect>, but was a <200: OK>
```

Implementation to get it through is quite easy. Simply create a method that will verify that the `premium_until` attribute of the connected user is greater than `DateTime.now`. Then simply call this method using a [controler _hook_](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/AbstractController/Callbacks/ClassMethods.html#method-i-before_action). The is the code:

```ruby
# app/controllers/acts_controller.rb
class ActsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :redirect_if_not_premium, only: %i[index]
  # ...

  private

  def redirect_if_not_premium
    redirect_to root_path if current_user.nil? or current_user.premium_until < DateTime.now
  end
end
```

> The `current_user` method allows me to retrieve the user connected to the application. To implement it, I recommend that you use [Authlogic](https://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic)

There you go. The test should now pass! The creation of the logic for the user mode is now complete. Let's move on (finally) to Stripe!

## Punctual payment

We set up logic to restrict some pages to premium users. We also created the method who will add one month of premium account to a user. All that remains is to call this method when a payment is made.

First of all, to use Stripe, you need to create an account that will allow you to get an _API key_. Once this is done, integration into your Rails application is pretty easy thnaks to [Stripe's gem](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ruby/)! Of course we'll use it here.

So let's start by adding this gem to our project:

```bash
bundle add stripe
```

In this first version we will simply set up a Stripe punctual payment and call `User#increment_premium` if everything goes well. In Stripe terms, a simple payment is a _charge_.

So we will create a `charges` controller that will contain two actions:

- `new` which will simply propose a form to pay
- `create` who will receive Stripe's answer

So let's generate all this with `rails generate` command :

```bash
rails generate controller charges new create
```

All we have to do now is modify the code generated by Rails. First of all, we modify routes:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # ...
  resources :charges, only: %i[new create]
  # ...
end
```

The actions are then implemented in the controller:

```ruby
# app/controllers/charges_controller.rb
class ChargesController < ApplicationController
  # display Stripe form to make a new payment
  def new; end

  #  & check all data from Sripe
  def create
    # Amount in cents
    @amount = 500

    # get customer from POST params
    customer = Stripe::Customer.create(
      email: params[:stripeEmail],
      source: params[:stripeToken]
    )

    begin
      charge = Stripe::Charge.create(
        customer: customer.id,
        amount: @amount,
        description: 'Rails Stripe customer',
        currency: 'eur'
      )
      current_user.increment_premium!
    rescue Stripe::CardError => e
      flash[:error] = e.message
      redirect_to new_charge_path
    end
  end
end
```

That's represent a lot of code. Let me take a look at `create` method:

1. `Stripe::Customer.create` will register the user on Stripe. Stripe will take care of all the checks for us (card validity, information transmitted, etc...)
2. `Stripe::Charge.create` will create the _charge_ and linking it to the _customer_ we just created
3. We call the `increment_premium` method to add credit to the user

It is Look very easy. Now, we modify the views a little bit and generate a form:

```erb
<!-- app/views/charges/new.html.erb -->
<h1>Subscribe to a monthly subscription</h1>
<p>Currently, your premium account is available until <%= current_user.premium_until.strftime('%d/%m/%Y') %></p>
<%= form_tag charges_path do %>
  <script src="https://checkout.stripe.com/checkout.js" class="stripe-button"
          data-key="<%= Rails.application.secrets.stripe[:publishable_key] %>"
          data-description="A month's subscription"
          data-amount="500"
          data-locale="auto"></script>
<% end %>
```

```erb
<!-- app/views/charges/create.html.erb -->
<h1>Votre paiement a été accepté</h1>
<p>Le paiement a été effectué. Votre compte premium à été étendu au <%= current_user.premium_until.strftime('%d/%m/%Y') %></p>
```

We end with configuration. Simply retrieve the API keys via the Stripe interface and add them to the `secrets.yml` file.

```yaml
# config/secrets.yml
development:
  stripe:
    publishable_key: pk_test_azerty
    secret_key: sk_test_clef_a_ne_pas_commiter

test: &development

production:
  stripe:
    publishable_key: pk_live_azerty
    secret_key: sk_live_clef_a_ne_pas_commiter
```

> Of course you must enter _your_ own\* key here

And now to create the necessary configuration in a Stripe-specific _initializer_:

```ruby
# config/initializers/stripe.rb
Rails.configuration.stripe = {
  publishable_key: Rails.application.secrets.stripe[:publishable_key],
  secret_key: Rails.application.secrets.stripe[:secret_key]
}

Stripe.api_key = Rails.application.secrets.stripe[:secret_key]
```

Once the first version is implemented, it is enough to test that everything is going well.

> At the risk of disappointing you, I didn't invent anything and I almost pumped it all out of [Stripe's guide](https://stripe.com/docs/checkout/rails).

To test, launch the Rails server and connect to <http://localhost:3000/charges/new>. A button will take you to Stripe's form:

![Formulaire de paiement de Stripe](./images/stripe_first_form.png)

I have voluntarily used the card number `4242 4242 4242 4242 4242 4242` which is a test card. Some credits cards numbers allow you to simulate errors. The complete list of test cards is available [here](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards)

Once the form has been sent, you are redirected to the `charges#create` page which confirms your purchase. You can find the payment on Stripe in the section _payments_:

![Formulaire de paiement de Stripe](./images/stripe_first_payment.png)

### Save user's `cutomer_token`

We will make a small modification to the implementation proposed by Stripe. We want to save the _customer_ created by Stripe in order to reuse it if he pays again. We will therefore add a column `users.stripe_token`.

```
rails g migration add_stripe_token_to_users stripe_token:string
```

Nous allons créer un _concern_ qui va s'occuper de récupérer ou créer un _customer_ Stripe:

> If you are not comfortable with _concerns_, I talk about it in [this previous article](http://rousseau-alexandre.fr/tutorial/2018/12/03/zip-active-storage.html#factorisation).

```ruby
# app/controllers/concerns/stripe_concern.rb
module StripeConcern
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  protected

  # Try to retreive Stripe customer and create if not already registered
  # @params [User]
  # @return [Stripe::Customer]
  def create_or_retrieve_customer(user)
    customer = retrieve_stripe_customer(user)

    if customer.nil?
      customer = Stripe::Customer.create email: params[:stripeEmail], source: params[:stripeToken]
      user.update! stripe_token: customer.id
    end

    customer
  end

  private

  # @params [User]
  # @return [Stripe::Customer|Nil]
  def retrieve_stripe_customer(user)
    return nil if user.stripe_token.nil?

    begin
      customer = Stripe::Customer.retrieve user.stripe_token
      return customer
    rescue Stripe::InvalidRequestError
      # if stripe token is invalid, remove it!
      user.update! stripe_token: nil
      return nil
    end
  end
end
```

It is now time to modify a little our controller to use it.

```ruby
# app/controllers/charges_controller.rb
class ChargesController < ApplicationController
  include StripeConcern
  # ...

  def create
    # Amount in cents
    @amount = 500

    customer = create_or_retrieve_customer(current_user)

    begin
      charge = Stripe::Charge.create(
        customer: customer.id,
        amount: @amount,
        description: 'Rails Stripe customer',
        currency: 'eur'
      )
      current_user.increment_premium!
    rescue Stripe::CardError => e
      flash[:error] = e.message
      redirect_to new_charge_path
    end
  end
end
```

There you go! The operation is identical but now we get the customer back if he already exists. We can also do without the Stripe button if the user already has a token:

```erb
<!-- app/views/charges/new.html.erb -->
<h1>Subscribe to a monthly subscription</h1>
<p>Currently, your premium account is available until <%= current_user.premium_until.strftime('%d/%m/%Y') %></p>
<%= form_tag charges_path do %>
  <% if current_user.stripe_token %>
    <%= submit_tag 'Payer avec votre compte Stripe' %>
  <% else %>
    <script src="https://checkout.stripe.com/checkout.js" class="stripe-button"
            data-key="<%= Rails.application.secrets.stripe[:publishable_key] %>"
            data-description="A month's subscription"
            data-amount="500"
            data-locale="auto"></script>
  <% end %>
<% end %>
```

## Subscription

Don't give up, we're almost done. One of the last features to be created is to offer a subscription. The user will be able to make a subscription that will trigger an automatic payment at the beginning of the month. According to Stripe this is called a [_subscriptions_](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/products-and-plans).

> Each plan is attached to a product who represents (...) the service provided to customers. Products can have more than one plan, reflecting price and duration variations - such as monthly and annual prices at different rates. There are two types of products: goods and services (...) which are intended for subscriptions.

### Creating plan

So let's create our first product using [Stripe's gem](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ruby/). Here is an example with the Rails console (You can do the same thing using the administration interface).

```ruby
2.6.0 :001 > product= Stripe::Product.create name: 'Premium account subscription', type: 'service'
 => #<Stripe::Product:0x3fe4f20a1420 id=prod_EMb13PJreiAcF2> JSON: {
2.6.0 :002 > plan = Stripe::Plan.create amount: 5000, interval: 'month', product: product.id, currency: 'eur', id: 'premium-monthly'
 )
  => #<Stripe::Plan:0x2ab3e0b46d24 id=premium-monthly> JSON: {
```

> Here again I didn't invent anything, everything is [in Stripe's documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscriptions/object?lang=ruby)

So we get a pretty Ruby instance corresponding to a _Plan_. We will just write thet `id` into the `secret.yml` file:

```yaml
# config/secrets.yml
development:
  stripe:
    premium_plan_id: premium-monthly
    # ...
```

### Creating logic

As we have created a `charges` controller, we will create a new one named `subscriptions` with two methods:

- `new` which will simply propose a form to pay
- `create` who will receive Stripe's answer

Let's use the `rails generate` command once again

```bash
rails generate controller subscriptions new create
```

We have to modify generated routes a little bit:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :subscriptions, only: %w[new create]
  # ...
end
```

Implementation of `SubscriptionsController` is almost identical to the `ChargesController` (that's why we previously created a _concerns_ to avoid code duplication). We just need to call the method `Stripe::Charge.create`:

```ruby
class SubscriptionsController < ApplicationController
  include StripeConcern

  before_action :check_login
  before_action :only_advocates

  def new; end

  def create
    customer = create_or_retrieve_customer(current_user)

    begin
      Stripe::Subscription.create(customer: customer.id, items: [{ plan: Rails.application.secrets.stripe[:premium_plan_id] }])
    rescue Stripe::CardError => e
      flash[:error] = e.message
      redirect_to new_subscription_path
    end
  end
end
```

And views:

```erb
<!-- app/views/subscriptions/new.html.erb -->
<h1>Subscribe to a monthly subscription</h1>
<p>Subscribe to reload your account automatically every month</p>
<%= form_tag subscriptions_path do %>
  <% if current_user.stripe_token %>
    <p class="text-center">
      <%= submit_tag t('premium.pay'), class: 'btn btn-primary btn-lg' %>
    </p>
  <% else %>
    <script src="https://checkout.stripe.com/checkout.js" class="stripe-button"
        data-key="<%= Rails.application.secrets.stripe[:publishable_key] %>"
        data-image="<%= image_url 'favicon.png' %>"
        data-name="iSignif SAS"
        data-description="Compte premium pendant un mois"
        data-email="<%= current_user.email %>"
        data-locale="auto"></script>
  <% end %>
<% end %>
```

```erb
<!-- app/views/subscriptions/create.html.erb -->
<h1><%= @title %></h1>
<p>Le débit préautorisé est maintenant configuré</p>
```

There you go. We can now take out a subscription.

#### Setting up the _Webhook_

We have set up a monthly payment but we want to be notified of the payments made. In our case, the _workflow_ type is as follows:

1. the user makes a subscription request
2. Stripe creates a subscription for this user
3. when the subscription is renewed (i.e. when Stripe invoices the customer and it is re-invoiced).

Stripe sends a request to report that the payment has been made through the _hook_. _Webhooks_ are simply routes that we make available to receive requests from Stripe. Once the route is created, we must communicate the URL to Stripe via the Stripe administration interface (this is very easy).

![Formulaire de création d'un Webhook](./images/stripe_webhook.png)

> Note that I have chosen to receive only the signal `invoice.payment_succeeded` that is sent when an invoice is paid. Once again I'm not making anything up, everything is [in Stripe's documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/webhooks#tracking)

Let's generate a route with Rails.

```bash
rails g controller  hooks stripe --no-assets --no-helper
```

We will just delete views created by Rails and pass accessible route with the HTTP `POST` verb:

```bash
rm -r app/views/hooks
```

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  post 'hooks/stripe'
  # ...
end
```

Now it is enough to add a method in the controller that will receive Stripe's request, as usual, let's start with the tests.

### Functional tests

It is always complicated to test API integration so I simply chose to simulate a request from Stripe and check if our controller adds credit to the user. To do that I simply copied/pasted the parameters sent by Stripe via their[webhooks test interface](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks/).

![Test d'envoie d'un Webhook via l'administration](./images/stripe_webook_request.png)

Once the request was copied, I transformed it into a Ruby `Hash` and keep only parameters that interest me.

```ruby
# test/controllers/hooks_controller_test.rb
# ...
class HooksControllerTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  # Stripe webook params copied from <https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks>
  STRIPE_INVOICE_SUCCEEDED_PARAMS = {
    id: 'invoice.payment_00000000000000',
    type: 'invoice.payment_succeeded',
    # ...
    data: {
      object: {
        customer: 'cus_00000000000000',
        # ...
      }
    },
    # ...
  }.freeze

  # ...
end
```

Now just send a `POST` request and check that our user is incremented.

```ruby
# test/controllers/hooks_controller_test.rb
# ...
class HooksControllerTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  # ...
  setup do
    @user = users(:one_advocate)
  end

  test 'Stripe hook should add premium days to the given user' do
    old = user.premium_until
    post hooks_stripe_url, params: STRIPE_INVOICE_SUCCEEDED_PARAMS
    assert_response :success
    user.reload
    assert_operator old, :<=, user.premium_until
  end
end
```

There you go. The implementation is fairly simple:

```ruby
# app/controllers/hooks_controller.rb
class HooksController < ApplicationController
  protect_from_forgery except: [:stripe]

  def stripe
    if is_payment_succeeded?
      advocate = retrieve_user

      advocate.increment_premium! unless advocate.nil?
    end

    head :ok, content_type: 'text/html'
  end

  private

  def retrieve_user
    customer_token = params.dig(:data, :object, :customer)
    return nil if customer_token.nil?

    User.where(stripe_token: customer_token).first
  end

  def is_payment_succeeded?
    params[:type] == 'invoice.payment_succeeded'
  end
end
```

> Be careful to disable the `protect_from_forgery` which will block requests from outside.

And that's it, our recurring payment is now in place!

#### Test in development

You just need to use a service like [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [Serveo](https://serveo.net/) (I recommend the latter which is easier to use) to expose your application outdoors and then test your _webhook_ via [Stripe's webhooks test interface](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks/). I'm not going to show you here because we have already set up a test that simulates it for us.

## Conclusion

I have therefore demonstrated to you through this article that it is very easy to set up a recurring payment system with Stripe. The almost perfect documentation and their gem make it really easy for us.

But Stripe's features don't stop there. Stripe also allows us to set up an invoicing system (with the generation of beautiful PDF invoices), reimbursement or even dispute management.

I think that for the creation of your application it is much smarter to delegate all payment tasks to Stripe and focus on your business.
